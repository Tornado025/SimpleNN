# SimpleNN

This repo contains a simple implementation of a neural network built from scratch using NumPy . It was not designed with testing or performance kept in mind and was only made for understanding purposes 


## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+

- NumPy

- matplotlib (optional, for plotting)


## Features

- Dense layer 

- reLu and Sigmoid activations plus their derviatives for backpropagation

- Simple forward and backpropagation implementation

- MSE Loss


## Limitations

- Only supports single layer networks for now

- No support for batching or vectorised backpropagation
  

## Future Tweaks 

- Add support for multiple layers

- Add softmax and cross-entropy loss

- Support for multi-class classification


## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

- **Clone the repository**
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Tornado025/simplenn.git
  cd simplenn

- **Install dependencies (matplotlib if needed for plotting purposes)**
  ```bash
  pip install numpy matplotlib
